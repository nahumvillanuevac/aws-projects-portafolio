# Student Evaluation Program

## Description
This Python program evaluates a list of students based on their grades (notes).
It calculates each student's **average score** and assigns a performance category:

- **Excellent** -> Average >= 16
- **Ok** -> Average >= 14
- **Enough** -> Average >= 11
- **Fail** -> Average < 11

The results are printed in a formatted way, showing each student's name, average, and status.
