# Project: Basic Calculator with Tkinter

##Description
This is a simple Python application using **Tkinter** that works as a basic calculator with extra functions to find divisors of a number and check if a number is even or odd.

## Features
1. **Basic Calculator:**
  - Enter an operation with two integers and an operator (+, -, *, /)
  - Shows the result of the calculation.
  - Handles division by zero and invalid input with error messages.

2. **Find Divisors:**
  - Takes an integer as input.
  - Shows all divisors between 2 and 110 that divide the  number exactly.

3. **Check Ever or Odd:**
- Indicates if the entered number is even or odd.
- validates that the input is a valid number.

## How to use

1. Run the Python file.
2. In the window that opens, type into the text field:
  - For calculator: enter simple operations like `12+5`, `8*3`, or `10/2`.
  - For divisor or even/odd: enter a single integer, for example '24'.
3. Press one the buttons to perform the desired action:
  - **Calculator** to calculate the operation.
  - **Divisor** to show the divisors.
  - **Even or od** to check parity.
4. The result will appear below the buttons.
